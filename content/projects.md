## Technical

### *Flight Tracker*

Developed a travel app in Java with SQL for database management, enabling users to compare domestic flight prices, receive personalized price alerts, and track upcoming flights with real-time updates. This project showcases skills in API integration, database design, and data-driven solutions to enhance the travel planning experience.

### *Apple AirPlay Receiver for Fire TV*

I developed a custom Apple AirPlay receiver application for Amazon Fire TV using Android Studio and Kotlin, enabling wireless video streaming from Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, and macOS) directly to a Firestick. The app integrates and adapts open-source AirPlay technologies to function reliably within the Android TV environment, focusing on stable device discovery, low-latency video playback, and compatibility across local networks. This project demonstrates hands-on experience with Android development, network media streaming protocols, and cross-platform interoperability between Apple and Android ecosystems.

### *AI smart home project*
I am developing an AI-powered smart home security and automation system built in Python that uses facial recognition to control connected devices. The application leverages the InsightFace framework to identify known individuals in real time and trigger predefined smart home actions, while unknown faces immediately activate an alarm. In addition, the system integrates a local large language model (LLM) to enable intelligent, on-device control and decision-making without relying on cloud services. This project highlights experience in computer vision, AI-driven automation, local LLM integration, and secure smart home system design.

## Non-Technical

### *Giant Incident Response Plan*

Created a detailed guide outlining Giant’s policies for handling cyber threats and in-store incidents, including data breaches, ransomware, and phishing attacks. The guide features clear response protocols and a disaster recovery plan to ensure swift system restoration and business continuity. This project highlights skills in cybersecurity policy development and disaster recovery planning.
