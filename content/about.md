Hello! I’m Matthew Gergus, a junior at Penn State, planning to graduate with a Master’s in Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations, with minors in Arabic and Security Risk Analysis.

I bring experience in Java, SQL, R, Kali Linux, Wireshark, Metasploit, Snort, and Windows Server, and I'm passionate about computers and cybersecurity. With a strong foundation in programming and networking, I’m always eager to expand my knowledge and skills in the field.

Currently, I serve as a Learning Assistant for the IST course SRA 221, where I lead exam reviews and offer tutoring through my office hours. Outside the classroom, I’m actively involved in Penn State’s Competitive Cyber Security Organization and the Red Cell Analytics Lab, both of which help me grow my technical and theoretical skills in cybersecurity and security risk analysis.

Each semester, I compete in the National Cyber League, a national cybersecurity competition. Over the past three semesters, I’ve ranked in the top 300, placing in the 95th percentile.
