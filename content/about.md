Hello! I’m Matthew Gergus, a senior at Penn State University, planning to graduate with a Bachelor’s Degree in Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations, with minors in Arabic and Security Risk Analysis.

I hold the CompTIA Security+ certification and bring experience in Java, Python, SQL, Kali Linux, Splunk, Wireshark, Metasploit, Palo Alto Panorama, and Windows Server. I’m deeply passionate about computers and cybersecurity, and with a strong foundation in programming, networking, and security fundamentals, I’m always eager to expand my knowledge and skills in the field.

Currently, I serve as a Learning Assistant for the IST course CYBER 221, where I lead exam review sessions and provide academic support through weekly office hours. Outside the classroom, I’m actively involved in Penn State’s Competitive Cyber Security Organization and the Red Cell Analytics Lab, experiences that continue to strengthen both my technical capabilities and analytical approach to security risk analysis.

Each semester, I compete in the National Cyber League, a national cybersecurity competition. Over the past three semesters, I have consistently ranked in the top 300 competitors, placing in the 95th percentile overall.
